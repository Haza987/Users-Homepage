TODO:
Make ListContactsView show an empty screen if no contacts have been created
Make it possible to edit and delete contacts in ListContactsView.
Make it so only one contact is created when the button is pressed.
Make it so when you press okay on the successfully created contact dialouge, the user is taken to the main menu.


UpdateContactList();

        // GitHub Copilot suggested this updated method so that it works with IContactService.
    public void UpdateContactList()
    {
        Debug.WriteLine("UpdateContactList called");
        _contactList = new ObservableCollection<ContactItem>(_contactService.GetAllContacts().ToList());
    }
