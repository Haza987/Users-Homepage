Some method tests might not be working as intended. It was very complicated to test methods that use async task.
I looked for advice online and asked GitHub Copilot however it was too complicated to figure out at this moment in time.
This might be why there are some methods that are not tested.

I have marked the methods that I attempted to test with the comment "// This test might not be working correctly".
I have marked the methods that I could not test correctly with the comment "// This test is not working correctly".

I have not tried to test the methods that are in a View due to these complications.
